Introduction
Through the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course offered by Coursera, I have been learning about the six stages of the data analysis process (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, & act), and how to use tools such as SQL, Tableau, and R to gather insights from data. With what I have learned throughout the course, I will be completing an analysis on the Cyclistic Case Study showing the process step by step.

Background
For this case study, I will be assuming the role of ‘Jr. Data Analyst’ at Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in Chicago that offers over 6,000 bikes at 800+ docking stations spread across Chicago. They currently offer classic bikes and electric bikes for use and have two customer segments: Casuals and Members. Casuals are customers who either buy a single-trip pass or a day pass, and Members are customers who buy annual memberships. My goal is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. 

I will do this by focusing on how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.

Ask
Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. The director of marketing and my manager, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Moreno wants to convert the casual riders into members rather than target all-new customers. To help them complete this goal, I have been asked to find “How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?”.

Prepare
To approach this question, I will be analyzing the historical Cyclistic bike trip data for all 12 months of 2022. The data is bias-free, reliable, and collected by Cyclistic and stored on the company’s database separated by each month and year in a CSV format. For this analysis, I have saved the 12 CSV files for each month of 2022 on my local drive.

Process
To begin, I combine and clean the data using SQL on Google’s BigQuery Platform.
